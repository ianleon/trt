This project is about serving LLMs on the DGX platform.

This is running on a DGX Spark.

Here is some relevant documentation:

https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/1.0.0rc2/overview.html

You will help me to serve various models on this machine using TRT LLM Serve.

Your first goal is to make me a script that starts serving a model with an OpenAI compatible API on port 8355
